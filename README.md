# Presentation about research design

This repo hosts the presentation for our 'Forschungsprakikum' at University of Graz, held on 4th of November 2015.

The presentation is powered by [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js), which is included as a [git submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules).

Content is written to `forschungsvorhaben.md`, which is then converted with the `makefile` to `index.html`. Styling is done via `forschungsvorhaben.css`.
